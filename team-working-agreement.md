# Team Smarties™ Working Agreement - Phase 1

## Communication
- **How will we communicate? (Slack, Discord, email, etc.)**
Discord. There will be a class server for the who class, within it we will have a dedicated Team Black Bears channel.
- **Response time expectations? (within 24 hours)**
24 hours for an informed response (ex. If you need your laptop to look at code), 2-3 hours for a response to acknowledge the messages.
- **When are we available? (time zones, schedules)**
Tuesdays/Thursdays between 3-7 is best. If we need to figure out a time, everyone fills out a Timefull. 
- **UNCA Google Calendar: Can we assume they're up-to-date?**
We’ll use timefull to determine specific times as needed. 
- **How will we share updates? (daily? weekly? as needed?)**
At the very least weekly. Tuesdays (updates in person) + as needed (detailed text messages). 

## Meetings
- **How often will we meet? (weekly? as needed?)**
At the very least weekly on Tuesdays
- **How long? (1 hour? 2 hours?)**
3:30 pm 5:30 pm.
- **Where? (in-person? Zoom? hybrid?)**
In person, in the 3rd floor of RRO.
- **What's the agenda? (standup? planning? coding together?)**
    - Where we’re at
    - Where we’re trying to get + blockers
    - Co-Coding
    - Consider doing evaluations of the previous week. What worked about our team-style, what could be improved, what caused trouble. PLEASE be open if you struggled with something or with another person.

## Work Distribution
- How will we divide work? (volunteer? rotate? assign?)
Collaborative assignment. Identify what needs to get done and work together to divide it logically and assign/volunteer takers.
- How will we ensure everyone contributes?
Expect contribution, but be ready to address people by name who are not meeting the predetermined expectations.
- What if someone is struggling?
If you are struggling PLEASE reach out as quickly and openly as possible, it is better for the team to know and be able to support each other, rather than for people to struggle individually.

## Code Review
- Who reviews PRs? (everyone? specific people?)
Everyone, rotate per assignment. This rotation should be factored in during work distribution, and should take people's busyness into consideration. When making your PR assign that designated person. 
- How quickly should reviews happen? (within 24 hours?)
Within 24 hours. Communicate if you can’t do it, you are responsible for finding someone else who can.
- What makes a good review? (constructive, specific, kind)
See Dr. Sarah’s recourses on that.

## Conflict Resolution
- What if we disagree?
Fight in the parking lot. Have a mature conversation, over text if that makes you feel more comfortable.
- What if someone isn't contributing?
Involve teachers, after trying to handle the conflict within the group.
- How do we give feedback?
PRs, using the text channel. Be sure to use your please’s and thank you’s! 

## Learning & Growth
- How will we help each other learn?
Co-Coding sessions, share resources (maybe be more verbose about why a resource is good, rather than just dropping a link), be excited to share knowledge you have that the others might not.
- What if someone doesn't understand something?
If someone doesn’t understand something, they should spend less than a day truing to learn it before seriously reaching out. Other members should be willing to answer questions, share resources, give tips and corrections, but are not wholly responsible for the person’s learning.
- How do we celebrate successes?
Invest team budget into Smarties for classical conditioning. Otherwise, use spoken and texted praise. Stay engaged with the text channel (increases team bonding).
