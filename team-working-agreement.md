# Team Smarties™ Working Agreement - Phase 1

## Communication
- **How will we communicate? (Slack, Discord, email, etc.)**
Discord. There will be a class server for the who class, within it we will have a dedicated Team Black Bears channel.
- **Response time expectations? (within 24 hours)**
24 hours for an informed response (ex. If you need your laptop to look at code), 2-3 hours for a response to acknowledge the messages.
- **When are we available? (time zones, schedules)**
Tuesdays/Thursdays between 3-7 is best. If we need to figure out a time, everyone fills out a Timefull. 
- **UNCA Google Calendar: Can we assume they're up-to-date?**
We’ll use timefull to determine specific times as needed. 
- **How will we share updates? (daily? weekly? as needed?)**
At the very least weekly. Tuesdays (updates in person) + as needed (detailed text messages). 

## Meetings
- **How often will we meet? (weekly? as needed?)**
At the very least weekly on Tuesdays
- **How long? (1 hour? 2 hours?)**
3:30 pm 5:30 pm.
- **Where? (in-person? Zoom? hybrid?)**
In person, in the 3rd floor of RRO.
- **What's the agenda? (standup? planning? coding together?)**
    - Where we’re at
    - Where we’re trying to get + blockers
    - Co-Coding
    - Consider doing evaluations of the previous week. What worked about our team-style, what could be improved, what caused trouble. PLEASE be open if you struggled with something or with another person.

## Work Distribution
- How will we divide work? (volunteer? rotate? assign?)
Collaborative assignment. Identify what needs to get done and work together to divide it logically and assign/volunteer takers.
    - Once work is split up, one member is responsible for sending a Discord message summarizing the divison of work. After this, the person responsible for the work should make any related Issues on GitHub, and definetly needs to make a Pull Request detailing what they've done regarding their task. That person must also assign at least one person to review the PR. It is likely this person will be pre-determined during the Discord messaging stage, but if they are not. The group should hold a quick discussion (in person or over text) to determine who is available to look over it. 
- How will we ensure everyone contributes?
Expect contribution, but be ready to address people by name who are not meeting the predetermined expectations.
- What if someone is struggling?
If you are struggling PLEASE reach out as quickly and openly as possible, it is better for the team to know and be able to support each other, rather than for people to struggle individually.

## Code Review
- Who reviews PRs? (everyone? specific people?)
Everyone, rotate per assignment. This rotation should be factored in during work distribution, and should take people's busyness into consideration. When making your PR assign that designated person. 
    - Even if you have no suggestions for improvement on a PR, still leave a comment on it. This reaffirms that you have spent time truly reviewing the code, and haven't just blindly approved it for merging.
- How quickly should reviews happen? (within 24 hours?)
Within 24 hours. Communicate if you can’t do it, you are responsible for finding someone else who can.
- What makes a good review? (constructive, specific, kind)
See Dr. Sarah’s recourses on that.

## Conflict Resolution
- **Disagreements About Implementation:** 
  - Discuss in the Discord chanel and/or at team meetings, give each perspective time to list why they think their implementation would fit the project better. Then hold a discussion where everyone open-mindedly considers the pros and cons of each implementation. Be willing to concede your side if logic presents a better option. This project isn't about who comes up with *more* of the solutions, but which solutions are *best*.
  - If no consensus is met, vote (majority rules)
  - Escalate to instructor if needed, be ready to provide a small written analysis about the implementation you are suggesting.
- **Interpersonal Disagreements**
    - Such disagreements should be handled privately. Please try not to bring issues like this into the Discord chanel or meetings, unless the disagreement is causing a safety concern or making one member of the group uncomfortable to be around the other. 
    - Try to come to a mutual understanding, even if that understanding is that the two parties won't see eye-to-eye on the topic. Remember that this team project will only last for a few weeks.
    - In extreme cases, involve an instructor.
- **Non-contribution:**
  - The team should take great care to clearly define the individual expectations for each person. If someone is not meeting these expectations by the agreed upon deadline, or seems to be significantly falling behind prior to the deadline, check in with them privately first (maybe they're struggling?).
    - If they are struggling, than the team should be willing to re organize tasks / expectations in a way that is appropriate.
  - If the behavior continues, especially without decent communication from the team member in question, discuss in team meeting.
  - Finally, escalate to instructor if needed
- **Feedback:** 
  - Give feedback directly and kindly. Try to focus not only on things for improvement, but also things that the other person did well. Acknowledging these things can help the team identify good habits and qualities that everyone hone in on, as well has negative practices that can be improved upon.
  - Focus on behavior, not personality
  - Use "I" statements ("I feel..." not "You always...")


## Learning & Growth
- How will we help each other learn?
Co-Coding sessions, share resources (maybe be more verbose about why a resource is good, rather than just dropping a link), be excited to share knowledge you have that the others might not.
- What if someone doesn't understand something?
If someone doesn’t understand something, they should spend less than a day truing to learn it before seriously reaching out. Other members should be willing to answer questions, share resources, give tips and corrections, but are not wholly responsible for the person’s learning.
- How do we celebrate successes?
Invest team budget into Smarties for classical conditioning. Otherwise, use spoken and texted praise. Stay engaged with the text channel (increases team bonding).
