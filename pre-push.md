## What to do before you push
### Remove All Debug Code and Make sure the Code Runs
Make sure console logs/print statements are removed. If you have blocks of commented code, delete it (if reasonable) to keep the codebase clean.
### Run All Linters:
Backend: `docker exec -it tma_backend bash scripts/fix.sh`

Frontend: `docker exec -it tma_frontend npm run fix`

Mobile: `cd mobile` then `npm run fix`
### Run All Tests:
-*Feel free to remove the `:verbose`*-

Backend: `docker exec -it tma_backend poetry run pytest`

Frontend: `docker exec -it tma_frontend npm run test:verbose`

Mobile: `cd mobile` then `npm run test:verbose`
### Make sure Commits are Clean
If you want to add more files or change the commit message to make sure commits are clean do the following.

Change just the message: `git commit -m "New Message" --amend. `

Add/Change Files: Stage your new changes `git add .`  then `git commit --amend` (Combines them with the last commit) 

Then use `git push --force` when pushing
### Rebase with Main
```
# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull

# Rebase your branch onto latest main
git checkout your-branch
git rebase main

# Continue rebase after resolving conflicts
git add .  # stage the edits you made
git rebase --continue

# Abort rebase if something goes wrong
git rebase --abort
```
### Finally, Push the Commit

## For the PR
Make sure that the "base repository" is **rsciaudo/tma-starter-app** (it usually doesn't default to this, so make sure you check), then choose the desired branch for the "compare:" option.
